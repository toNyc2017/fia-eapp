PROJECT OVERVIEW
===============

You're building a Fixed Indexed Annuity (FIA) Electronic Application (eApp) platform for Ceres Life. This is a sophisticated financial application system that allows financial advisors to submit applications for FIA products on behalf of their clients.

KEY REQUIREMENTS & CONTEXT
==========================

Application Structure (13 main sections):
1. Start Page / Authentication
2. Applicant Information  
3. Beneficiary Designation
4. Plan Type & Qualified Funding
5. Product Selection
6. Rider Selection
7. Index Strategy Allocation
8. Replacement Questionnaire
9. Banking Information
10. Agent Validation
11. Suitability Questionnaire
12. Review & Signature
13. Submission & Status Handling

Technical Integrations:
- GIACT: Bank account validation (REST API)
- NIPR: License validation (SOAP)
- 1035 Yellow Pages: Replacement annuity validation
- BIG: OFAC screening
- FAST: ACORD 103-compatible export
- Snowflake: Internal ETL for metadata logging

Key Features:
- Dynamic reflexive questions
- Multiple funding types
- Customizable rider selection
- Allocation logic across crediting strategies
- Third-party data validations
- Complex validation rules (e.g., SSN uniqueness + OFAC, allocation percentages must sum to 100%)

Development Approach:
- Modular development using internal engineers + AI tools
- Based on existing MYGA eApp experience
- Comprehensive field-level specifications with validation logic
- TypeScript/React frontend with robust API integrations

FIELD-LEVEL SPECIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS
====================================

Example validation rules:
| Field Name                  | Required | Type        | Validation Logic                                 |
|----------------------------|----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Owner SSN                  | Yes      | SSN         | Must pass regex + uniqueness + OFAC             |
| Plan Type                  | Yes      | Dropdown    | One of [Non-Qualified, IRA, Roth, SEP]          |
| Index Allocations          | Yes      | Integer %   | Sum must = 100                                  |
| Rider Payout Age           | If rider | Integer     | Must be ≥ 59.5 and ≤ 90                         |
| Bank Routing Number        | Yes      | 9-digit int | GIACT call; must pass ABA checksum              |
| State of Sale              | Yes      | Dropdown    | Used in NIPR license validation                 |
| Replacement Carrier Name   | If repl. | Text        | Required if Replacement = Yes                  |

INTEGRATION NOTES
================

- GIACT: REST API with JSON payload
- NIPR: SOAP-based license validation
- 1035 Yellow Pages: GET/POST exchange
- BIG: OFAC screening (binary flag + reason code)
- FAST: ACORD 103-compatible export (via secure SFTP or API POST)
- Snowflake: Call internal ETL endpoint to log app metadata

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
==================

- Allow multiple product types in single session (FIA + MYGA toggle)
- Auto-recommendation of allocation mix based on client profile
- AI suitability assistant to flag inconsistencies
- Mobile-native UI enhancement

PROJECT CONTEXT
==============

This project builds upon the existing MYGA (Multi-Year Guaranteed Annuity) eApp experience, incorporating lessons learned and expanding functionality for the more complex FIA product. The FIA product includes additional investment options (index-linked crediting strategies) and more rider options (e.g., guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits) compared to the simpler MYGA product.

The development team consists of internal engineers working with AI tools for rapid iteration, following a modular approach where sections of the PRD can be fed to AI coding agents for piece-by-piece development.
