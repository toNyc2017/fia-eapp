  --------------------  ok. now for something new.
Ok. So from all the outputs you’ve created for the various questions and prompts I’ve given to you above, you obviously know a lot about the business I and my colleagues are trying to build. 
We’ve been quite frustrated with the interactions we’ve had with the team building and configuring our eApplication tool (eApp). This is the piece of software we use to allow financial advisors to enter information about their clients, the product they desire to buy, the source of the funds used to purchase their annuities, their beneficiaries, etc. 
It strikes me that with the help of AI, we should be able to build the next eApp that we need by ourselves, using a couple of internal engineers. We started with the MYGA product. We now have an eApp mostly built for that. This has a lot of reflexive questions and drop downs and rules to ensure the fields are being filled out in a valid way. There are also several call outs to third party tools to help with some of these validations – eg to GIACT to make sure clients’ bank account information is valid, to 1035 Yellow pages in case this is a replacement annuity, NIPR to make sure financial advisor or sales agent licenses are valid for a specific product in a specific state. To BIG to make sure clients are not on any OFAC lists…. 
Next we need to build an eApp for the FIA or Fixed indexed Annuity product we are rolling out. 
I’m thinking that using today’s cutting edge AI research and code generation tools , plus two knowledgeable engineers that understand both AI and our business should be able to get this done. 
The first thing I’d like to do is build a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that we can have a couple of humans look at and modify and we can then feed sections of the PRD to an AI coding agent to build out the eApp in a piece by piece, modular way. 
You probably already know all about writing PRDs, but just in case, I found the attached page from atlassian useful. We use Jira and confluence extensively at my company. https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20PRD?,among%20business%20and%20technical%20teams. 
We have several sources of information that we can use to help inform the AI-driven product requirement document preparation effort. I am attaching each of these documents. They are: 
- a spreadsheet that details the test cases we have had our operations people running to make sure that the MYGA eApp we’ve built is working properly (this is called TestBed.Master.xlsx). down the left most column of this spreadsheet are the names of the fields that are filled in during the eApplication process. There is column for each of the 400 or so test cases the team prescribed. Not all of these fields represented by the rows are always filled in for every case (eg, in many cases there will be only one beneficiary, not multiple, several are mutually exclusive ie product plan_type cnnot be both non qualified and Roth IRA, etc. ) and many/ most of these are to be filled out in the eApp by choosing for a drop down menu (eg you can choose a 3,5, or 7 year term for our MYGA) 
- MYGA eApp launch prep Jira board download . this file is called Jira Export Excel CSV (all fields) 20250616125028.csv 
this includes all the issues we’ve needed the eApp developers to build and fix and debug over time each row contains many columns, possibly most importantly a ‘summary’ column and a ‘description’ column. From this I’m thinking the AI that is preparing the Product Requirements Document can get a good sense of things that have gone wrong in our MYGA eApp build, important features, etc. 
-MYGA Product Specification 
-FIA Product Specification (a FIA is quite similar to a MYGA but contains many more investing options eg earned rate is linked to one of several indices. It also tends to include more riders that the policyholder may choose form among. – eg guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits) 
- description of the Data pipelines and processes we’ve built (this is called cursor_partial_understanding_data_snowflake.md ). My thinking is this gives a good idea of the data artifacts that we need to produce as we run our business and a good description of some of the business rules that apply to various aspects of our system 
-Screenshots of some of the screens in the MYGA app we’ve built. These are in a file called eApp_Screenshots.pptx
I also include a copy of a paper version of the application we filed with state regulatros for both the MYGA (called MOA.MYGAApplication.20241017_MMREV20250217.docx ) and for the FIA (called MOA.FIA.Application.20250417.docx)
So now, with all of your previous background context and with the attached documents, please create for a me a detailed Product Requirements Document for our FIA product that we can use to drive the AI Code generation effort to build this eApp.
