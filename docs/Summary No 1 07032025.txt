## **Ceres FIA eApp Project – Progress & Context Summary**

### **Project Overview**
- **Goal:** Build a modern, demoable Fixed Indexed Annuity (FIA) electronic application (eApp) for Ceres Life.
- **Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Supabase (moving from localStorage to cloud DB), CSS-in-JS and custom styles.

### **Features Implemented**
- **Login Page:** With agent name, email, and password fields; session management; Dev Mode toggle.
- **Application Launcher:** Start/resume applications by session.
- **Multi-step Form Flow:** Applicant Info, Product Selection, Owner Info, Joint Owner, etc.
- **Dynamic Forms:** Fields loaded from JSON for Owner/Joint Owner.
- **Product Selection:** Options from JSON.
- **Logging:** User actions, navigation, and errors tracked; exportable logs.
- **Dev Mode:** Toggle to skip required field validation for fast UI testing.
- **Styling:** Modern, clean, Ceres-branded look and feel; responsive design.
- **Sidebar Navigation:** Persistent left nav bar (except on Login/Launcher), highlights current step, allows jumping to any section.

### **Current State**
- All main UI flows and navigation are working.
- Dev Mode and validation logic are robust.
- LocalStorage is used for data persistence (for now).
- Supabase CLI is installed and ready for cloud integration.

### **Next Steps**
- **Supabase Integration:**
  1. Log in to Supabase CLI and link local project to cloud project.
  2. Define and migrate schema for eApp data (using CLI migrations).
  3. Update React app to save/load data from Supabase instead of localStorage.
- **(Optional) Further UI/UX refinements, more form steps, or advanced features.**

### **Key Decisions**
- Using Supabase Cloud for easy local/cloud dev and future scalability.
- All schema and migrations will be managed programmatically via Supabase CLI.
- Project is ready for collaborative, version-controlled development.
