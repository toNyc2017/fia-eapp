**User**

can you please tell me what this project is about?

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you understand what this project is about. Let me explore the codebase to get a better understanding.

First, let me check the root directory structure.


Let me check the README.md file as it typically contains project documentation.


Let me also check the migrations directory to understand the database structure.


Based on my exploration, I can tell you that this is a Snowflake database project that uses a tool called "Schemachange" for managing database changes and deployments. Here are the key aspects of the project:

1. **Purpose**: This is a database management project for Snowflake that implements a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process using Schemachange.

2. **Database Objects**: The project manages various Snowflake objects including:
   - Databases
   - Schemas
   - Stages
   - Integrations
   - Tables
   - Views
   - Stored Procedures
   - Tasks
   - Streams
   - Users
   - Roles
   - Grants

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Developers work on feature branches
   - Changes are pushed through a structured deployment process
   - The project follows a multi-environment deployment strategy:
     - DEV environment
     - UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment

4. **Deployment Process**:
   - Changes start in feature branches
   - Pull requests are created to merge into DEV
   - After DEV deployment, changes can be promoted to UAT
   - Each deployment is tracked in a `SCHEMACHANGE.CHANGE_HISTORY` table in Snowflake

5. **Version Control**: The project uses Git for version control, with a structured branching strategy and pull request workflow.

This appears to be a well-organized database project that follows modern DevOps practices, ensuring controlled and tracked changes to the Snowflake database environment. The use of Schemachange suggests it's following database version control best practices, making database changes more manageable and traceable.

Would you like me to explore any specific aspect of the project in more detail?

ok.  I'm new to snowflake (though the team that built this project reports to me).
can you please find a way to walk me thorugh this rpoject in detail, starting somewehre logical?  I'm thinking I may need to try to get involved and do some work, likely with your hlep: )

I'll help you understand Snowflake and this project in a structured way. Let's start with the basics and work our way up.

First, let me check if there are any SQL files in the migrations directory that we can use as examples.


Let me check the VersionFiles directory first, as it might contain the initial setup:


Let me look at one of the simpler table definitions to help explain the structure:


Let me also check one of the more complex tables to show you the full structure:


Let me help you understand this project step by step:

1. **Project Structure Overview**:
   - This is a Snowflake database project that appears to be managing insurance-related data
   - It uses a tool called "Schemachange" for version control of database objects
   - The project follows a multi-environment approach (DEV, UAT)

2. **Database Organization**:
   The database is organized into several layers:
   - `DB_{{ENV_SUFFIX}}_RAW`: Raw data layer
   - `DB_{{ENV_SUFFIX}}_HARMONIZED`: Processed and standardized data
   - Each database has multiple schemas (like `SCH_FAST`, `SCH_COMMON_DATA_MODEL`)

3. **Key Components**:
   Looking at the migrations directory, we can see several types of database objects:
   - Tables (in VersionFiles)
   - Views (in 3_Views)
   - File Formats (in 4_FileFormats)
   - Functions (in 5_Functions)
   - Procedures (in 6_Procedures)
   - Tasks (in 7_Tasks)

4. **Data Model**:
   The project appears to be managing insurance-related data with tables for:
   - Cases (TB_DIM_CASE)
   - Agents (TB_DIM_AGENT)
   - Policies (TB_DIM_POLICY)
   - Parties (TB_DIM_PARTY)
   - Requirements (TB_DIM_REQUIREMENT)
   - And many more related entities

5. **Development Workflow**:
   - Developers work on feature branches
   - Changes are tracked in version-controlled SQL files
   - The naming convention for files is `V{version}__{description}.sql`
   - Changes are deployed through a CI/CD pipeline from DEV to UAT

To get started with this project, I would recommend:

1. **First Steps**:
   - Get access to the Snowflake environment
   - Review the existing tables and their relationships
   - Understand the data flow from raw to harmonized layers

2. **Learning Path**:
   - Start with simple queries on existing tables
   - Review the views to understand how data is transformed
   - Look at the procedures to understand business logic
   - Study the tasks to understand scheduled operations

Would you like me to:
1. Show you how to write a simple query to explore the data?
2. Explain more about any specific component (tables, views, procedures)?
3. Help you understand the deployment process in more detail?
4. Look at the data transformation logic in the views?

Let me know what interests you most, and we can dive deeper into that aspect!

**User**

yes this is for managing data for our start up annuity provider.  we are using a plicy admin system called FAST and catpturing data mostly emanating fro events generated by the FAST system, and transmitted to us via KAfka, I think

---

**Cursor**

Ah, this helps provide important context! Let me explore the project with this understanding in mind.

Let me look for files related to FAST and Kafka event processing:


Let me also check for any Kafka-related files:


Now I have a much better understanding of your project! Let me break down how this system works:

1. **Data Flow Architecture**:
   - FAST (your policy admin system) generates events
   - These events are sent to AWS Kafka
   - The events are then captured in Snowflake through an AWS Event Log table
   - The data is processed through multiple layers in Snowflake

2. **Data Processing Layers**:
   - **Raw Layer** (`DB_{{ENV_SUFFIX}}_RAW`):
     - Initial landing zone for data
     - Contains raw event data from Kafka
     - Stores commission extracts and API data
   
   - **Harmonized Layer** (`DB_{{ENV_SUFFIX}}_HARMONIZED`):
     - Processed and standardized data
     - Contains dimensional models for business entities
     - Implements SCD (Slowly Changing Dimension) type 1 and 2 for historical tracking

3. **Key Business Entities** (from the data model):
   - Policies (`TB_DIM_POLICY`)
   - Cases (`TB_DIM_CASE`)
   - Agents (`TB_DIM_AGENT`)
   - Parties (`TB_DIM_PARTY`)
   - Requirements (`TB_DIM_REQUIREMENT`)
   - Commissions (`TB_DIM_COMMISSION`)
   - Tasks (`TB_DIM_TASK_LIST`)

4. **Data Quality & Validation**:
   - There's a comprehensive data quality process (`SP_FAST_DQ_PK_BR_DATA_VALIDTION`)
   - Validates primary keys and business rules
   - Tracks data quality issues in validation tables

5. **Processing Components**:
   - **Event Processing**: Captures Kafka events into `AWS_EVENT_LOG`
   - **Commission Processing**: Handles commission data through `SP_FAST_COMMISSION_LOAD_RAW` and `SP_FAST_COMMISSION_LOAD_HARMONIZED`
   - **Task Processing**: Manages tasks through `SP_FAST_TASK_LOAD_RAW` and `SP_FAST_TASK_LOAD_HARMONIZED`
   - **API Integration**: Has API endpoints for data retrieval (`SP_FW_LOAD_RAW_API`)

Would you like me to:
1. Explain any specific part of this architecture in more detail?
2. Show you how to query specific business data?
3. Help you understand the data quality validation process?
4. Look into the event processing pipeline in more detail?

Let me know what aspect you'd like to explore further!

**User**

ok.  quick question about how Curosr works.  If I close this intance of cursor then re opena nd open this same project, will this chat history still be here?

---

**Cursor**

No, the chat history will not persist if you close and reopen Cursor. Each time you open Cursor, you start a fresh conversation. This is why it's often helpful to:

1. Save important information from our conversation if you need to reference it later
2. Take notes of key findings or decisions
3. If you need to continue a complex discussion, you might want to keep the Cursor window open

If you do need to close Cursor and come back later, you can always start a new conversation and I can help you get back up to speed on the project. I'll be able to see the same codebase and help you understand the context again.

Would you like me to summarize the key points we've discussed about your FAST/Snowflake project so you can save them for reference?

---

**User**

no. I'll take notes.  thanks.

above, you say this:
Data QualityÂ & Validation:
There's a comprehensive data quality process (SP_FAST_DQ_PK_BR_DATA_VALIDTION)
Validates primary keys and business rules


I'm curious about the 'business rules' you reference.
how do these appear?  I'd like to know what 'business rules' are effectively encoded in this project, if  possible



---

**Cursor**

I'll look into the business rules encoded in the data quality validation process. Let me examine the validation procedure in detail.


After analyzing the data quality validation procedure, I can identify several key business rules that are encoded in the system. Here are the main categories of business rules:

1. **Primary Key Validation Rules**:
   - Ensures no null values in key identifiers
   - Checks for duplicate entries
   - Validates across multiple entities:
     - Agents (NPN and Distributor Name)
     - Cases (Case Certificate Number)
     - Policies (Policy Number)
     - Requirements (Requirement ID)
     - Tasks (Task ID)
     - Commissions (Commission ID)

2. **State Code Format Rules**:
   - State codes must be exactly 2 characters long
   - Applied to:
     - Carrier Appointments (`TB_DIM_CARRIER_APPOINTMENT.STATE_CODE`)
     - State Licenses (`TB_DIM_STATE_LICENSE.LICENSE_STATE_CODE`)

3. **Agent Requirement Rules**:
   - Specific product training requirements:
     - MYGA products require "AGENT PRODUCT SPECIFIC TRAINING"
   - Standard requirements that apply regardless of product:
     - "ERRORANDOMISSION"
     - "AGENT PRODUCT SPECIFIC TRAINING"
     - "BIG BACKGROUND CHECK"
     - "ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING"

4. **Relationship Rules**:
   - Case-Agent relationships must have valid Case Certificate Numbers and Agent IDs
   - Policy-Party relationships must have valid Policy Numbers, Party IDs, and Role Types
   - Case-Party relationships must have valid Case Certificate Numbers, Party IDs, and Role Types

5. **Timestamp Validation Rules**:
   - Modified timestamps cannot be null
   - Modified timestamps cannot be '1900-01-01T00:00:00.0000000' (invalid date)
   - Applied to:
     - Case Notes
     - Requirement Notes
     - Requirement Status
     - Task List

6. **Consumption Layer Rules**:
   - Application Tracker must have complete information:
     - Distributor Name
     - Application Number
     - Writing Code
     - Party ID
     - Requirement ID
     - Case Status
     - Note ID
     - Requirement Note

7. **Commission Rules**:
   - Commission records must have valid Policy Numbers and Writing Codes
   - No duplicate commission records for the same policy and writing code combination

8. **Task Tracking Rules**:
   - Tasks must have valid IDs and modified timestamps
   - No duplicate tasks with the same ID and timestamp

These business rules are enforced through a combination of:
1. Primary key constraints
2. Data type validations
3. Format validations
4. Relationship validations
5. Business logic validations

The system tracks violations of these rules in the `TB_DQ_DATA_VALIDATION` table, which records:
- The type of validation that failed
- The table and columns involved
- The validation result
- The validation status (PASS/FAIL)
- When the validation was executed

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these business rules or explain how they're enforced in more detail?

**User**

are there details/ can you infer details aobut what sort of Requirements there may be that relate to these Requirement IDs you mention above?

---

**Cursor**

Let me search for more details about the requirements in the system.


Let me also look for any requirement-related tables:


Based on the code analysis, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the requirements system in your annuity provider's data model:

1. **Core Requirement Types**:
   - **Agent Product Specific Training**: Required for MYGA (Multi-Year Guaranteed Annuity) products
   - **Error and Omission**: General requirement for all agents
   - **Big Background Check**: Standard background check requirement
   - **Anti-Money Laundering**: Standard AML training requirement

2. **Requirement Structure**:
   Each requirement has several key attributes:
   - `REQUIREMENT_ID`: Unique identifier
   - `REQUIREMENT_TYPE`: Type of requirement
   - `CASE_CERTIFICATE_NUMBER`: Associated case
   - `COMPLETION_DATE`: When the requirement was completed
   - `IS_MANDATORY`: Whether the requirement is mandatory
   - `IS_AGENT_VIEWABLE`: Whether agents can see this requirement
   - `IS_CLIENT_VIEWABLE`: Whether clients can see this requirement
   - `LAST_FOLLOW_UP_DATE`: Last follow-up date for the requirement
   - `REQUIREMENT_START_TIMESTAMP`: When the requirement was created

3. **Requirement Notes**:
   Requirements can have associated notes with:
   - `NOTE_ID`: Unique note identifier
   - `NOTE`: The actual note content
   - `NOTE_CATEGORY`: Category of the note
   - `NOTE_PRIORITY`: Priority level of the note
   - `NOTE_TYPE`: Type of note
   - `SUMMARY`: Summary of the note
   - `IS_CLIENT_VIEWABLE`: Whether clients can see this note
   - `MODIFIED_TIMESTAMP`: When the note was last modified

4. **Requirement Status**:
   Requirements have a status tracking system with:
   - Status changes tracked over time
   - Modified timestamps for status changes
   - Historical tracking of requirement states

5. **Agent Requirements**:
   Requirements are linked to agents through:
   - `AGENT_ID`: The agent identifier
   - `DISTRIBUTOR_NAME`: The distributor the agent works with
   - `PRODUCT`: The specific product (e.g., MYGA)
   - Product-specific requirements (e.g., MYGA training)

6. **Business Rules**:
   The system enforces several business rules:
   - MYGA products require specific agent training
   - Certain requirements (Error and Omission, Product Training, Background Check, AML) are standard and apply regardless of product
   - Requirements can be mandatory or optional
   - Requirements can be visible to agents, clients, or both
   - Requirements have follow-up dates for tracking

7. **Data Quality Checks**:
   The system validates:
   - No null requirement IDs
   - No duplicate requirements
   - Valid timestamps
   - Proper requirement type assignments
   - Complete requirement information

This requirements system appears to be designed to track and manage various compliance and training requirements for agents selling annuities, with particular attention to:
- Product-specific training requirements
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Background checks
- Anti-money laundering training
- Case-specific requirements
- Agent-specific requirements

Would you like me to dive deeper into any particular aspect of the requirements system?
