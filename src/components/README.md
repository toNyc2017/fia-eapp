# Components

This directory contains reusable React components for the application.

## Structure

- `common/` - Shared components used across multiple pages
- `forms/` - Form-specific components
- `layout/` - Layout and navigation components
- `ui/` - Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)

## Guidelines

- Each component should be in its own directory with an index.tsx file
- Include a README.md for complex components
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow the naming convention: PascalCase for component names
