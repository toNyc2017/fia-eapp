# API

This directory contains API-related code for communicating with backend services.

## Structure

- `services/` - API service functions organized by domain
- `types/` - TypeScript interfaces for API requests/responses
- `config/` - API configuration (base URLs, headers, etc.)
- `hooks/` - Custom hooks for API calls

## Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all API-related code
- Implement proper error handling
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related API calls into service modules
