# Pages

This directory contains page-level React components that represent different routes in the application.

## Structure

- Each page should be in its own directory with an index.tsx file
- Include page-specific components in subdirectories
- Use TypeScript for all pages
- Follow the naming convention: kebab-case for directory names

## Guidelines

- Pages should be the top-level components for each route
- Keep pages focused on layout and composition rather than business logic
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utility functions
